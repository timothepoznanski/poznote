## Option 1: Railway (Recommended)

Railway.com offers the easiest way to install Poznote in the cloud. The platform provides:
- Automated deployments
- Automatic HTTPS
- Easy scaling
- One-click updates
- No infrastructure management

### Installation on Railway

Create a Railway account at [Railway.com](https://railway.com) and choose the **$5/month plan**.

4. Navigate to the **Settings** tab
5. Find your public URL in the **Networking** section

**Step 2: Log In**

**Default Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123!`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Change these default credentials after your first login!

Your instance URL will look like: `https://poznote-production-xxxx.up.railway.app` but you can change it. See the [deployment tutorial video](https://youtu.be/RkN0-v8sz2w) to see how to. 

### Get Your Instance URL

Railway will automatically:
- Pull the latest Poznote image
- Redeploy your instance
- Preserve all your data (notes, attachments, database)

## Option 2: Other Cloud Providers

If you prefer using another cloud platform, Poznote can be deployed on any service that supports Docker containers.

### Generic Docker Deployment

Most cloud platforms accept standard Docker deployment configurations. Use this as a starting point:

**Docker Image:**
```
ghcr.io/timothepoznanski/poznote:latest
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
SQLITE_DATABASE=/var/www/html/data/database/poznote.db
POZNOTE_USERNAME=admin
POZNOTE_PASSWORD=admin123!
HTTP_WEB_PORT=8040
```

**Docker Run Command (for platforms that support it):**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name poznote-webserver \
  --restart always \
  -e SQLITE_DATABASE=/var/www/html/data/database/poznote.db \
  -e POZNOTE_USERNAME=admin \
  -e POZNOTE_PASSWORD=admin123! \
  -e HTTP_WEB_PORT=8040 \
  -p 8040:80 \
  -v ./data:/var/www/html/data \
  ghcr.io/timothepoznanski/poznote:latest
```

**Docker Compose (if supported):**
```yaml
services:
  webserver:
    image: ghcr.io/timothepoznanski/poznote:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      SQLITE_DATABASE: /var/www/html/data/database/poznote.db
      POZNOTE_USERNAME: ${POZNOTE_USERNAME}
      POZNOTE_PASSWORD: ${POZNOTE_PASSWORD}
      HTTP_WEB_PORT: ${HTTP_WEB_PORT}
    ports:
      - "${HTTP_WEB_PORT}:80"
    volumes:
      - "./data:/var/www/html/data"
```

### Key Considerations

When deploying to custom cloud providers, keep these important points in mind:

**1. Persistent Storage**
- ‚úÖ Ensure the platform supports **persistent volumes** for the `./data` directory
- ‚úÖ Data must persist across container restarts and redeployments
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Without persistent storage, you'll lose your notes on every restart

**2. Networking & Security**
- ‚úÖ Configure firewall rules to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- ‚úÖ Set up SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS (most platforms do this automatically)
- ‚úÖ Consider using a custom domain name
- ‚úÖ Ensure the platform exposes port 80 or maps to your configured port

**3. Backups**
- ‚úÖ Set up regular backups of the `./data` directory
- ‚úÖ Use Poznote's built-in backup feature (Settings ‚Üí Backup)
- ‚úÖ Store backups in a separate location (cloud storage, local machine)

### Manage

The management of your Poznote instance will depend on your chosen cloud provider. Each platform has its own interface and procedures for:

- **Configuration**: Accessing and modifying environment variables (username, password, port settings)
- **Updates**: Redeploying with the latest Poznote Docker image
- **Monitoring**: Viewing logs and managing your instance
- **Password Recovery**: Accessing your credentials through the platform's interface

Please refer to your cloud provider's documentation for specific instructions on how to manage Docker-based applications and environment variables.
