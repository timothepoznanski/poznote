- **Updates**: Redeploying with the latest Poznote Docker image
- **Monitoring**: Viewing logs and managing your instance
- **Password Recovery**: Accessing your credentials through the platform's interface

Please refer to your cloud provider's documentation for specific instructions on how to manage Docker-based applications and environment variables.
