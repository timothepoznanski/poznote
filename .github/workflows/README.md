# GitHub Actions Workflows Configuration

This repository contains **optimized GitHub Actions workflows** to automate production deployment with validation.

## Deployment workflow (optimized for speed)

### Pull Request approach with manual merge (semi-automated)
- **Trigger** : Push to `dev` branch
- **Action** : Automatic PR creation `dev` ‚Üí `main` for manual review *(~1-2 minutes)*
- **Deployment** : Manual merge, then automatic deployment to production
- **Auto-sync** : `dev` branch automatically synchronized with `main` after deployment
- **Benefits** : Additional review step, controlled deployment, **faster CI/CD pipeline**
- **Safety** : Automated tests + conflict detection + manual review

## Required configuration

### GitHub Repository Settings (Important!)
To avoid unnecessary commits and keep branches synchronized:

1. Go to your repository ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **General** ‚Üí **Pull Requests**
2. **Uncheck** "Allow merge commits" 
3. **Check** "Allow squash merging" (recommended)
4. **Check** "Allow rebase merging" (alternative)
5. **Check** "Automatically delete head branches" (optional cleanup)

This prevents GitHub from creating unnecessary merge commits that would desynchronize your branches.

### Merge strategy recommendation:
- ‚úÖ **Use "Squash and merge"** for cleaner history
- ‚úÖ **Use "Rebase and merge"** to preserve individual commits  
- ‚ùå **Avoid "Create a merge commit"** (causes branch desynchronization)

You must configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions) :

### Required secrets
- `PROD_HOST` : Production server IP address or domain name
- `PROD_USERNAME` : SSH username for server connection
- `PROD_SSH_KEY` : Private SSH key for authentication
- `PROD_SSH_PASSPHRASE` : SSH key passphrase (if your key has one)
- `PROD_PORT` : SSH port (usually 22)
- `PROD_PROJECT_PATH` : Absolute path to project on server (ex: `/root/poznote/poznote`)
- `PAT_TOKEN` : GitHub Personal Access Token to create Pull Requests
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` : Docker Hub username (for registry push / Not the email address)
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` : Docker Hub password or access token

### SSH Configuration
1. Generate an SSH key pair on your production server:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "github-actions@yourdomain.com"
   ```

2. Add the public key to the target user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file

3. Copy the private key to the `PROD_SSH_KEY` secret

4. **If your key has a passphrase**: Add the passphrase to the `PROD_SSH_PASSPHRASE` secret

### GitHub Personal Access Token Configuration
1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give the token a name (ex: "Poznote Auto Deploy")
4. Select the following permissions:
   - ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ‚úÖ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and add it to the `PAT_TOKEN` secret

### Alternative option: Key without passphrase
If you prefer, you can create a dedicated SSH key without passphrase for GitHub Actions:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/github_actions_key -N ""
```
In this case, you don't need the `PROD_SSH_PASSPHRASE` secret.

## Usage

The workflow works automatically:

1. **Push to `dev`** ‚Üí Automatic PR creation for manual review
2. **Manual merge** after review ‚Üí Automatic deployment to production

### Workflow process
1. Develop on the `dev` branch
2. Push your changes: `git push origin dev`
3. **Conflict detection** - Checks if dev can merge cleanly into main
4. **Automated tests run** (PHP syntax, Docker build, etc.)
5. **If no conflicts AND tests pass**: A PR will be automatically created (`dev` ‚Üí `main`) for manual review
6. **If conflicts OR tests fail**: No PR is created, deployment is blocked
7. **Manual merge** of the PR after review triggers automatic deployment to production

**Note**: The deployment includes multiple safety checks: conflict detection + automated testing + manual review before merge.

## File structure

```
.github/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auto-pr-production.yml         # Tests + Auto PR creation dev ‚Üí main
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production-deployment.yml      # Deployment after merge to main
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                      # This file
```

## What actually happens

### Production deployment process:
1. **GitHub Actions runner** connects via SSH to your server (simple relay)
2. **Your server** executes `git pull origin main` to fetch the new code
3. **Your server** executes `docker compose build` to build the image locally
4. **Your server** executes `docker compose up -d` to start the new containers
5. **No merge commits** = branches stay synchronized automatically
6. **Everything happens on your server** - the runner only transmits SSH commands

### Why no manual pushes needed anymore:
- ‚úÖ **With "Squash and merge"**: No extra commits, `dev` and `main` stay in sync
- ‚úÖ **With "Rebase and merge"**: Clean linear history, no desynchronization  
- ‚ùå **With "Create merge commit"**: Creates extra commits that desynchronize branches

**Result**: After deployment, your local `dev` branch is automatically up to date when you `git pull`!

## Customization 

You can modify the workflows according to your needs:
- **Add more tests** in `auto-pr-production.yml` (database tests, API tests, etc.)
- Modify Docker commands according to your configuration
- Add notifications (Slack, Discord, email)
- Configure staging environments
- Add security scans or dependency checks

### Available tests in `auto-pr-production.yml`:
- ‚úÖ **Docker build test** - Ensures the application can be built *(~3-5 minutes)*
- ‚úÖ **Docker Compose validation** - Checks compose file syntax *(~10-30 seconds)*  
- ‚úÖ **PHP syntax check** - Validates all PHP files *(~30-60 seconds)*
- ‚úÖ **Merge conflict detection** - Prevents PR creation if conflicts exist *(~5-10 seconds)*
- ‚úÖ **Changes detection** - Skips PR creation if no changes between branches *(~5-10 seconds)*

### Performance optimization
The workflow has been optimized for faster deployment:
- ‚ö° **Docker build test removed by default** - Saves 3-5 minutes per deployment
- ‚ö° **Only essential tests remain** - PHP syntax + Docker Compose validation
- ‚ö° **Total workflow time**: ~1-2 minutes instead of 5-7 minutes
- üîß **Re-enable Docker build test** if needed by uncommenting the step in the workflow

### Adding custom tests:
You can add more tests to `auto-pr-production.yml` such as:
- Database connection tests
- API endpoint testing
- Security vulnerability scans
- Performance tests
- Code quality checks (PHPStan, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Error "divergent branches" during deployment
This error occurs when the production server's local git state differs from the remote repository:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic handling**: The workflow now handles this automatically with `git reset --hard origin/main`
- ‚úÖ **Backup created**: A backup branch is created before resetting (backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)
- ‚úÖ **Clean deployment**: Ensures production always matches the exact state of `main` branch
- ‚úÖ **No manual intervention needed**: The deployment process handles conflicts automatically

### Manual recovery (if needed)
If you need to recover to a previous state:
```bash
# On production server, list backup branches
git branch | grep backup-

# Restore to a specific backup
git checkout backup-20250721-214500  # example timestamp
git checkout -b recovery-branch
```

### Error "refusing to merge unrelated histories"
This error occurs when `dev` and `main` branches were created independently:
- ‚úÖ **This is normal for new repositories** - the workflow handles this automatically
- ‚úÖ **The system will use `--allow-unrelated-histories`** for the conflict check
- ‚úÖ **No action needed** - the workflow adapts to this situation

### Error "Merge conflicts detected"
This error occurs when your `dev` branch has changes that conflict with `main` during merge:
- ‚úÖ **First, update your dev branch with latest main**: `git checkout dev && git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories` (add flag if needed)
- ‚úÖ **Resolve conflicts manually** in your code editor  
- ‚úÖ **Commit the resolved conflicts**: `git add . && git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"`
- ‚úÖ **Push again**: `git push origin dev`
- ‚úÖ **The workflow will automatically retry** the PR creation process

### Error "invalid header field value for Authorization"
This error indicates a problem with the Personal Access Token:
- ‚úÖ Check that the `PAT_TOKEN` secret is properly configured in your repository
- ‚úÖ Make sure the token hasn't expired
- ‚úÖ Verify that the token has `repo` and `workflow` permissions
- ‚úÖ The token should not contain spaces or special characters at the beginning/end

### Tests failing
If automated tests fail and block deployment:
- ‚úÖ **Check the Actions tab** on GitHub to see which test failed
- ‚úÖ **Fix the issue** in your dev branch
- ‚úÖ **Push the fix**: The workflow will run again automatically

### SSH connection error
- Check that the SSH key is properly configured
- Make sure the user has sudo permissions if necessary

### Docker error
- Check that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the server
- Make sure the user is in the `docker` group

### Git error
- Check that the repository is cloned on the production server
- Make sure the `main` branch exists and is tracked
