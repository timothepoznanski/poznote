## Option 2: Other Cloud Providers

If you prefer using another cloud platform, Poznote can be deployed on any service that supports Docker containers.

### Supported Platforms

Poznote works with any Docker-compatible cloud platform, including:

- **[DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform)** - Simple PaaS with Docker support
- **[Render](https://render.com)** - Easy deployment with free tier available
- **[Fly.io](https://fly.io)** - Global edge deployment
- **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)** - Classic PaaS platform
- **[AWS ECS/Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)** - Enterprise-grade AWS container service
- **[Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)** - Serverless container platform
- **[Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/)** - Simple container deployment
- **And many more...**

### Generic Docker Deployment

Most cloud platforms accept standard Docker deployment configurations. Use this as a starting point:

**Docker Image:**
```
ghcr.io/timothepoznanski/poznote:latest
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
SQLITE_DATABASE=/var/www/html/data/database/poznote.db
POZNOTE_USERNAME=admin
POZNOTE_PASSWORD=admin123!
HTTP_WEB_PORT=8040
```

**Docker Run Command (for platforms that support it):**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name poznote-webserver \
  --restart always \
  -e SQLITE_DATABASE=/var/www/html/data/database/poznote.db \
  -e POZNOTE_USERNAME=admin \
  -e POZNOTE_PASSWORD=admin123! \
  -e HTTP_WEB_PORT=8040 \
  -p 8040:80 \
  -v ./data:/var/www/html/data \
  ghcr.io/timothepoznanski/poznote:latest
```

**Docker Compose (if supported):**
```yaml
services:
  webserver:
    image: ghcr.io/timothepoznanski/poznote:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      SQLITE_DATABASE: /var/www/html/data/database/poznote.db
      POZNOTE_USERNAME: ${POZNOTE_USERNAME}
      POZNOTE_PASSWORD: ${POZNOTE_PASSWORD}
      HTTP_WEB_PORT: ${HTTP_WEB_PORT}
    ports:
      - "${HTTP_WEB_PORT}:80"
    volumes:
      - "./data:/var/www/html/data"
```

### Key Considerations

When deploying to custom cloud providers, keep these important points in mind:

**1. Persistent Storage**
- ‚úÖ Ensure the platform supports **persistent volumes** for the `./data` directory
- ‚úÖ Data must persist across container restarts and redeployments
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Without persistent storage, you'll lose your notes on every restart

**2. Networking & Security**
- ‚úÖ Configure firewall rules to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- ‚úÖ Set up SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS (most platforms do this automatically)
- ‚úÖ Consider using a custom domain name
- ‚úÖ Ensure the platform exposes port 80 or maps to your configured port

**3. Backups**
- ‚úÖ Set up regular backups of the `./data` directory
- ‚úÖ Use Poznote's built-in backup feature (Settings ‚Üí Backup)
- ‚úÖ Store backups in a separate location (cloud storage, local machine)

**4. Resource Requirements**
- **Memory:** Minimum 512MB, recommended 1GB
- **CPU:** 1 vCPU is sufficient for personal use
- **Storage:** Depends on your usage (starts around 100MB)

**5. Environment Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Always change default credentials after deployment
- ‚úÖ Use strong passwords
- ‚úÖ Configure environment variables securely (use platform's secret management)
